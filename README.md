  - Content type (documentation, tutorials, examples)
  - Spark components (Core, SQL, Streaming, MLlib, GraphX)
  - Difficulty level and target audience
  - Technology stack and programming language

### üìä Analytics & Insights

- **Collection Metrics**: Track total sources, analysis completion rates, and quality scores
- **Trend Analysis**: Monitor source addition patterns and identify knowledge gaps
- **Quality Distribution**: Visualize relevance scores and content quality across the collection
- **Domain Analysis**: Understand which sources and domains provide the most value

### üîé Smart Search Interface

- **Semantic Search**: Find sources based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Multi-faceted Filtering**: Filter by source type, domain, quality score, and date
- **Relevance Ranking**: AI-powered ranking based on query context and source quality
- **Contextual Insights**: Each result shows extracted insights and learning highlights

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Icons**: Phosphor Icons for consistent iconography
- **AI Integration**: Spark LLM API for content analysis
- **Persistence**: Spark KV store for data persistence
- **State Management**: React hooks with persistent storage

## Usage

### Dashboard Overview
Monitor your collection's health with key metrics:

- Recent additions and their quality scores
- Processing queue and job statuses

### Adding Sources

#### Single Source Addition
1. Navigate to "Source Collector"
2. Enter the URL of the resource
3. Optionally specify source type or let the system auto-detect
4. Add a description to help with analysis
5. Submit for AI analysis

#### Batch GitHub Discovery
1. Use the "GitHub Discovery" tab
2. System automatically finds Spark-related repositories
3. Processes multiple sources simultaneously
4. Tracks progress and provides insights for each

#### Bulk Import
1. Use "Batch Import" for multiple URLs
2. Paste URLs line by line
3. System processes all sources sequentially
4. Provides detailed results for each item

### Search and Discovery
1. Use the search interface to find specific resources
2. Apply filters for source type, domain, or quality score
3. Sort results by relevance, date, or quality
4. View detailed insights for each source
5. Access external links directly

### Analytics and Reporting
- View collection growth trends over time
- Analyze source distribution by type and domain
- Monitor quality metrics and identify improvement areas
- Export data for further analysis
